## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the CSS framework, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system. It is intended to capture and convey the significant architectural decisions which have been made on the system.

### 1.2 Scope

This Software Design Document is focused on the structure, components, and specifications of the CSS framework for static site generators, specifically Hugo themes.

## 2. System Architecture

The system will follow a modular architecture style. The main components will be Base Styles, Components, Grid System, Media Queries, and Utilities. Each component will be developed and maintained independently but will work together to form the complete system.

## 3. Components Design

### 3.1 Base Styles

This component will contain global styles and resets. It will include a reset.css or normalize.css file to ensure consistent default styles across browsers, and a main.css file to define basic styles like font settings, colors, and typography.

### 3.2 Components

This component will contain individual UI components. Each UI component (like card, hero, navigation, etc.) will have its own CSS file. These files should contain styles specific to that component and be designed for reusability.

### 3.3 Grid System

This component will contain the grid system for the framework. It will include a grid.css file to define a responsive grid system using Flexbox or CSS Grid.

### 3.4 Media Queries

This component will contain the responsive design elements of the framework. It will include separate CSS files for different screen sizes (mobile.css, tablet.css, and desktop.css), using media queries to adjust styles based on screen width and orientation.

### 3.5 Utilities

This component will contain utility classes that can be used for quick adjustments and overrides in various parts of the website. It will include a utilities.css file to define utility classes for common styles like margin, padding, text alignment, etc.

## 4. Data Design

As this is a CSS framework, it does not directly interact with data in the traditional sense. However, the framework will define how data is presented and styled on the web pages that use it.

## 5. Interface Design

### 5.1 User Interface

The user interface will be determined by the developers who use the framework to build their websites. The framework will provide a set of CSS classes and components that developers can use to style their websites.

### 5.2 Software Interface

The framework will be designed to be compatible with Hugo, a popular static site generator. It will provide a set of styles and components that can be used to build Hugo themes.

## 6. Implementation Strategy

The project will be implemented in stages, starting with the base styles, then moving on to the components, grid system, media queries, and finally the utilities. Each stage will involve designing, coding, testing, and refining the respective part of the framework.

## 7. Testing Strategy

The framework will be tested on different devices and browsers to ensure it looks good and works as expected. This will involve both manual testing and automated testing using tools like Jest or Mocha for CSS.

## 8. Documentation

Documentation will be created alongside the development of the framework. It will explain how to use each component, apply the grid system, and utilize utility classes. It will also provide examples and code snippets for different use cases.

This document provides a high-level design of the CSS framework. It can be expanded and refined as the project progresses, and should serve as a guide for a novice CSS developer to start implementing the framework.
